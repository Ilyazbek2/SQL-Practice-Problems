Task: For each company, find the longest single-flight duration (time_in - time_out).
Fields in the resulting table:

name

max_flight_time (format HH:MM:SS â€” alias using AS)

Notes: Use TIMEDIFF to compute duration and MAX() grouped by company.

Solution (example):

SELECT c.name,
       SEC_TO_TIME(MAX(TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(t.time_in, t.time_out)))) AS max_flight_time
FROM Company c
JOIN Trip t ON c.id = t.company
GROUP BY c.name;
