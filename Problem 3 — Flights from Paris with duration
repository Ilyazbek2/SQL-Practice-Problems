Task: What cities can I fly to from Paris and how long will it take?
Fields in the resulting table:

town_to

flight_time (format HH:MM:SS â€” use AS flight_time)

Notes: Use TIMEDIFF(time_in, time_out) (MySQL) or equivalent.

Solution (example):

SELECT town_to,
       TIMEDIFF(time_in, time_out) AS flight_time
FROM Trip
WHERE town_from = 'Paris';
